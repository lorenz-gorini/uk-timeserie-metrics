# UK Timeserie Macro Analysis

This is the solution that me and Alex Basov submitted for the Problem Set of Timeserie Econometrics. The goal of this problem set was to analyze the UK Timeserie Macro dataset using various econometric techniques, including Vector Autoregression (VAR) models and impulse response functions.

For more details about the specific tasks and requirements, please refer to the [Lab exercises.pdf](./Lab%20exercises.pdf).

We analyzed the UK Timeserie Macro dataset, which contains quarterly data on various macroeconomic variables in the UK from 1955 to 2018. The dataset includes variables such as GDP, inflation, and interest rates.

We evaluated the performance of different VAR models, with multiple lag orders, using various metrics. We also performed a residual analysis to check for autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity in the residuals of the models.
